# Aalto Micro and nano robotics

Deadline for pre-assignments 11. March 2022

## Exercise 1
1. Answer the following questions:
    - What is the working principle of piezoelectric stick-slip actuator? 
    - What is Step mode?
    - What is Scan mode?
    - How does the control signal look like and why? What are the key parameters?
    - What is back-step movement during the control signal’s peak-to-peak sudden change?
    - What is the purpose of the pre-load force?

2. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of this type of actuator
    - Regarding to: resolution, range, control, step size, linearity, force and speed.

3. Familiarize yourself with the provided functions of the control system in the AB8_help_2022.html file. Explain the parameters of the following functions: 
    - Nanomanipulator.StepMove (cha, steps, stepSize, stepFreq)
    - Nanomanipulator.ScanMoveRelative (cha, disp, speed)

4. Read and understand Tasks 1 and 2 before coming to the Hands-on session.

## Exercise 2
1. Home assignment: Your group develops a control algorithm using a simulator (deadline for submission: 11.03.2022 – for all groups).

2. Pre-assignment questions: You can find the pre-assignment questions in the exercise document (Acoustic_Manipulation_2022.pdf). You are supposed to prepare for answering the questions individually before the lab. If the answers are not satisfactory, you do not get to operate the lab setup:
    - What are standing waves?
    - How can standing waves appear in a vibrating plate?
    - Where do particles tend to move to on a vibrating plate?
    - How can you control the movement direction of a particle on a vibrating plate?
    - What properties of the driving signal affect the movement speed of the particles?
    - What properties of the particles affect their movement speed?
    - When a plate is vibrated with a piezo stack actuator attached directly to it, what can limit the vibration and how?
    - How would you determine the resonance modes of a plate?
